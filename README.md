# Neumorphic Button/Switch/Toggle Button

Just a quick demo using SwiftUI to create some neumorphic components. For some reason the drag gesture doesn't detect `.onEnded` if you hold it down for too long. If anyone knows a better way that works, please let me know. 

Otherwise, feel free to use any of this stuff for your own projects.
